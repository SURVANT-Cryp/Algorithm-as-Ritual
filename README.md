“Get yourself out of whatever cage you find yourself in.”<br>
―John Cage

“In the wake of digital colonisation, increasingly intricate algorithms scout for patterns in the data we generate. The ever-expanding archive not only reflects our values and society—it shapes new cultures, behaviours, and beliefs. We posit that future rituals and algorithms can be rehearsed through performing arts, and propose an intervention that is part discussion, part social experiment, and strives to explore the combined functionalities.”<br>
—Diana Alina Serbanescu and Régis Lemberthe<br>

<i>Algorithm as Ritual</i> is a project exploring the ritualization of human-machine collaboration. The playlists for the show are generated by a computer program written in Python that randomly selects links to music files/URLs from an eclectic and continuously growing archive created and maintained by artist Patrick Quinn. Quinn searches far and wide for music to go into the archive, sifting through dusty crates in record stores and the immense flea market that is the Internet.
